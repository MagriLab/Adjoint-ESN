# Adjoint-ESN

 Adjoint methods offer a computationally cheap and accurate way to calculate the sensitivity of a quantity of interest with respect to the system parameters. 
 However, the accuracy of the adjoint relies on the physical model of the underlying system, which can be high-dimensional and highly nonlinear. 
 Echo State Networks (ESNs) have been shown to successfully learn nonlinear dynamics from data. 
 In this project, we obtain adjoint sensitivities from a parameter-aware ESN trained on data from different parameter regimes.

 Specifically, we consider a prototypical model of a thermoacoustic system, the Rijke tube, which is governed by the coupling of linear acoustics with a nonlinear and time-delayed heat release model.
